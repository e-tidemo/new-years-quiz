<h1 align="center">New Year's Eve Drunk Quiz</h1>

This is a quiz website for any New Year's Eve party where drinks are consumed (alcoholic or non-alcoholic). The aim of the game is to create some fun and as it is a drunk quiz, there are some features relating to that theme. These features include the rules that state that you should drink every time you answer a question incorrectly and each time you do click the incorrect answer, the page goes blurry.

The intended use for the quiz is for my New Year's Eve party so the quiz will be displayed on a big screen but then everyone will follow along and play on their own phones. This has affected some of the decisions on features when building the webpage.

- # User Experience (UX)
The overall goal was for the website to work on a range of different devices.
  
  - ## 1. Goals for a First Time Visitor
    - For a first time visitor, it is important that one can quickly grasp what the website is about.
    - For a first time visitor, it is also of great importance that the rules of the game is clear.
    - For a first time visitor, it is important that the game is easy to navigate.
    - For a first time visitor, it is also important that one can restart the game in case one of the rules were missed or one accidently advances too fast.
  - ## 2. Goals for a Frequent Visitor
    - For a frequent visitor many of the goals are similar as for the first time visitor but for a frequent visitor it is important to get the game started easily and quickly.
    - For a frequent visitor, it is also of value to be able to leave feedback about the quiz.

- # Features
  - ## Existing Features
   - ### Header
    In the header one can see a score count that increases with each correct answer and also a restart button that will bring the player back to the start of the quiz.
   - ### Name input
    At the start of the quiz, the player submits their name to the webpage and their name then appears next to the score-count in the header.
   - ### Blur effect
    As the concept is a "drunk quiz", there is a feature that blurs the background when the player answers a question wrong. This is to highlight the "punishment" which is to take a shot (found in the rules). Once the player answers another question correctly, the blur effect disappears again.
   - ### Play again?
    At the end of the quiz, the player is given three options - to play again, to leave feedback about the game or to leave the website. Leaving the website directs the player to google.com. If the player wants to leave some feedback on the game, they can click that button which will open a google form in a different window and if the player chooses to play again they are redirected to the start page.
  - ### Footer
    In the footer, there are links to social media pages where one could, in theory, follow the quizmakers' pages. There is also a link to the github repository where the project is stored as this is a project that people can keep building on and developing further.
    
  - ## Future Features
    The possibilities for improvements when it comes to an online quiz are endless but here are some realistic ideas that could improve this quiz further:

    - In the future, the quiz as a game would benefit a lot from having more questions and it displaying a random selection of these each round. That way one can play the game more times with more excitement. As it is now, one can replay the quiz until one finds all the correct answers but then it will become a bit boring and not very challenging.
    - Another future feature that would be neat is to have a timer for each question that gives you x amount of seconds to answer but as this quiz is intended to be used in a group, it was not applied this time around as it would have made the group following along in the same quiz a bit too complicated.

- # Design
  - ## Colour Scheme:
  ![colour palette](documentation/support-images/quiz-colors.png)
  The colour palette was inspired by the background image with the addition of white for contrast purposes so that the page will be as accessible as possible with sufficient contrasting colours.

  - ## Imagery
  ![Background image](assets/images/pexels-sebastian-hietsch-10967.webp)
  The imagery for the background was chosen to fit the theme of New Year's Eve and it needed to have enough details that the blur effect was effective enough. I also chose an image without text that would not distract from the contents of the webpage.

  - ## Typography
  Google fonts were used to import two different fonts:

   - Inconsolata - which was used for the paragraphs and questions
   - Silkscreen - which was used for all headings as well as the score

  The font for the headings was chosen to signal that the webpage is a game, as it is reminiscent of the early video games that were very pixelated.

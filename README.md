<h1 align="center">New Year's Eve Drunk Quiz</h1>

This is a quiz website for any New Year's Eve party where drinks are consumed (alcoholic or non-alcoholic). The aim of the game is to create some fun and as it is a drunk quiz, there are some features relating to that theme. These features include the rules that state that you should drink every time you answer a question incorrectly and each time you do click the incorrect answer, the page goes blurry.

- # User Experience (UX)
The overall goal was for the website to work on a range of different devices.
  
  - ## 1. Goals for a First Time Visitor
    - For a first time visitor, it is important that one can quickly grasp what the website is about.
    - For a first time visitor, it is also of great importance that the rules of the game is clear.
    - For a first time visitor, it is important that the game is easy to navigate.
    - For a first time visitor, it is also important that one can restart the game in case one of the rules were missed or one accidently advances too fast.
  - ## 2. Goals for a Frequent Visitor
    - For a frequent visitor many of the goals are similar as for the first time visitor but for a frequent visitor it is important to get the game started easily and quickly.
    - For a frequent visitor, it is also of value to be able to leave feedback about the quiz.

  - ## Existing Features
   - ### Header
    In the header one can see a score count that increases with each correct answer and also a restart button that will bring the player back to the start of the quiz.
   - ### Blur effect
    As the concept is a "drunk quiz", there is a feature that blurs the background when the player answers a question wrong. This is to highlight the "punishment" which is to take a shot (found in the rules). Once the player answers another question correctly, the blur effect disappears again.
   - ### Play again
    At the end of the quiz, the player is given three options - to play again, to leave feedback about the game or to leave the website. Leaving the website directs the player to google.com. If the player wants to leave some feedback on the game, they can click that button which will open a google form in a different window and if the player chooses to play again they are redirected to the start page.
  - ## Future Features
    - In the future, the quiz as a game would benefit a lot from having more questions and it displaying a random selection of these each time one plays. That way one can play the game more times with more excitement. As it is now, one can replay until one finds all the correct answers but then it will become a bit boring and not very challenging.
